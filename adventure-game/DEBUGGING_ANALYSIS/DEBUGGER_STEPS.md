# Debugging Analysis

This is a debugging analysis of the Game of Thrones adventure game.  
There are three breakpoints with explanations, and a critical state analysis.

## Breakpoint 1: `currentState = nextState`

### Why this breakpoint?

This ensures that the game correctly updates `currentState` when users make a choice.

### Screenshot1

Before

`currentState = "start"`
`nextState = "winterfell"`
Execution is paused at `currentState = nextState`

After

`currentState = "winterfell"`
Execution moves to `renderQuestion();`

### What changed?

The game successfully updated `currentState` based on user choice.
`renderQuestion();` will now execute to update the UI.

## Breakpoint 2: `questionElement.textContent = currentData.text;`

### Why this breakpoint?

This ensures that when `renderQuestion()` runs, it updates the UI with the correct story text.

### Screenshot2

Before

`currentState = "winterfell"`
`currentData.text = "You arrive at Winterfell..."`
`questionElement.textContent = "You wake up in Westeros..."` (old UI state)

After

`questionElement.textContent` updates to `"You arrive at Winterfell..."`
Execution moves to clearing old answers

### What changed?

The UI now correctly displays `"You arrive at Winterfell..."`
`answersElement.innerHTML` will be cleared next.

## Breakpoint 3: `nextBtn.style.display = "block";`

### Why this breakpoint?

This ensures that the `"Next"` button is only displayed when game's end.

### Screenshot3

Before

`currentState = "iron_throne"` (game end state)
`currentData.answers = undefined` (no choices left)
`nextBtn.style.display = "none"` (button is hidden)
![screenshot](./screenshot5_before_next_button.png)

After

`nextBtn.style.display = "block"` (button is now visible)
UI now shows the `"Next"` button for restarting the game
![screenshot](./screenshot6_after_next_button.png)

### What changed?

The `"Next"` button now appears
Ready to restart

## Critical State Analysis: "Next" Button Display

Before
`nextBtn.style.display = "none"`
After
`nextBtn.style.display = "block"` (Next button becomes visible)

### What does this state tell me?

This confirms that `nextBtn` only appears when no more answers.

### Does the program behave as expected? If applicable, explain how this state connects to your programâ€™s next steps

Yes, it does. Next step is that the players can restart the game.
